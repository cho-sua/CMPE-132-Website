I want first preferance that most of the website code was written by following this guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI by "Tech With Tim"
This guide was used in order to get the website up, however I did make edits to make my own and did not fully use it since I did not want to fully use it.
Some of the code can be found in the user's github: https://github.com/techwithtim/Flask-Web-App-Tutorial
Again, I wrote my code along side the video and used it as a guide for making my website!
